# babel-book-gen
This python script generates a book. A Microsoft Word document for its text, and a PDF for its cover. This book could be found in a version of the Library of Babel, where there are 46 lines per page and 56 characters per line (due to the size constraints of the book).

The output format of the book is perfect to have the book published and mailed to you via BookBaby.com. Choose a hard cover and 6"x9" page size, no ISBN necessary, and you can own the book generated by this script.
